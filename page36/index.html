    <h2 id="ugly-me-my-life-with-body-dysmorphia">Ugly Me: My Life with Body Dysmorphia</h2>

<p>In my researching of «a href=”/body-dysmorphic-disorder” title=”Body Dysmorphic Disorder”&gt;Body Dysmorphic Disorder&lt;/a&gt;, I found reference to a BBC documentary called “Ugly Me”. I googled it and found the resource embedded below.</p>

<p>This documentary follows the life of Liane and also includes short commentary by others living with <a href="/body-dysmorphic-disorder" title="Body Dismorphic Disorder">BDD</a> about their own struggles. The video is powerful and raw and, if someone you love suffers with <a href="/body-dysmorphic-disorder" title="Body Dismorphic Disorder">BDD</a>, it provides insights into this disorder and those struggling with it - please watch for those you love. It is difficult not feel empathy for those living every day with such vocal internal critics.</p>

        The Power of Group Therapy

    <h2 id="sharing-and-acceptance">Sharing and Acceptance</h2>

<p>What about group therapy provides an environment for positive life change? Is it the relationship with the therapist? Is it the relationship with other group members? Is it the therapeutic approach of the group leader? There has been much debate over the effect of these factors and others.</p>

<p>A group therapist with a great deal of experience (since the 1970s) argues that it is the interpersonal environment in which people show themselves and are accepted by others in the group.</p>

<blockquote>
It is the affective sharing of one's inner world <b>and then the acceptance by others</b> that seem of paramount importance. To be accepted by others challenges the client's belief that he or she is basically repugnant, unacceptable, or unlovable. The need for belonging is innate in us all. Both affiliation within the group and attachment in the individual setting address this need.<sup>1</sup>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="a-positive-feedback-loop">A Positive Feedback Loop</h2>

<p>The positive group environment creates a loop in which change builds upon change in a spiral of successful interactions. Taking the risk to share, feeling the support of others (and their understanding) and further creates and environment for therapeutic change.</p>

<blockquote>
Therapy groups generate a positive, self-reinforcing loop; trust-self-disclosure-empathy-acceptance-trust.<sup>ibid</sup>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="group-acceptance">Group Acceptance</h2>

<p>Some argue that in group therapy the group is artificial and group cohesion will not happen. Members will not trust each other. Members will not accept each other. Yalom disagrees, noting that groups will accept almost anyone, as long as a few conditions are met.</p>

<blockquote>
The group will accept an individual, provided that the individual adheres to the group's procedural norms, regardless of past life experiences, transgressions, or social failings. Deviant lifestyles, history of prostitution, sexual perversion, heinous criminal offenses - all of these can be accepted by the therapy group, so long as norms of nonjudgmental acceptance and inclusiveness are established early in the group.<sup>ibid</sup>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="first-chance-to-share">First Chance to Share</h2>

<p>Why is group therapy so effective for some people? Because some people have never had an environment in which they could safely share. Some people have never had positive feedback from others who care about them.</p>

<blockquote>
For the most part, the disturbed interpersonal skills of our clients have limited their opportunities for effective sharing and acceptance in intimate relationships. Furthermore, some members are convinced that their abbhorent impulses and fantasies shamefully bar them from social interaction.<sup>ibid</sup>
</blockquote>

<p>Group therapy provides members a place where they can share, get positive feedback, and be accepted by the others in the group - sometimes for the first time in their lives. Learning to interact in this group gives members skills that they can take into other social environments, building strong relationships for life.</p>

<p>I am currently reading a book on <a href="/body-dysmorphic-disorder" title="Body Dismorphic Disorder">BDD</a>. I have been listening to podcasts and reading on this topic for a few weeks.</p>

<p>The author of this text discusses some of the variations in <a href="/body-dysmorphic-disorder" title="Body Dismorphic Disorder">BDD</a>, but lists the following as the core of <a href="/body-dysmorphic-disorder" title="Body Dismorphic Disorder">BDD</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
Everyone with <a href="/body-dysmorphic-disorder" title="Body Dismorphic Disorder">BDD</a> is preoccupied with some aspect of their appearance that they consider ugly, unattractive, or “not right,” and everyone is distressed or doesn’t function as well as they might because of their appearance preoccupations.

        The Group Therapy Microcosm
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">21 Jul 2023</span>

    <h2 id="a-microcosm-of-interactions">A Microcosm of Interactions</h2>

<p>It can take quite awhile for an individual and a therapist to get to know each other well enough for change to take place in the client’s life. There are a number of reasons for this, including that the therapist often has to take the client’s interactions with others at face value until a relationship develops where the therapist can see how the client interacts within their therapeutic relationship.</p>

<p>Group therapy allows the therapist to observe clients interacting with each other. This provides a microcosm of social interactions, but even more:</p>

<blockquote>
Not only does the small group provide a social microcosm in which the maladaptive behaviour of members is clearly displayed, but it also becomes a laboratory in which is demonstrated, often with great clarity, the meaning and the dynamics of the behaviour. The therapist sees not only the behaviour but also the events triggering it and sometimes, more important, the anticipated and real responses of others.<sup>1</sup>
</blockquote>

<p>This context allows the therapist additional insights which can help in treating the client, but also allows clients in therapy the opportunity to see issues and resolutions for others and themselves.</p>

<h2 id="intersubjectivity">Intersubjectivity</h2>

<p>Watching a single client in group therapy isn’t just about what that client does, but involves the interchange of that client with others, including the therapist, and how meaning is created in these group interactions.</p>

<blockquote>
A traditional view of members' behaviour sees the distortion with which members relate events - either in their past or within the group interaction - as soley the creation and responsibility of that member. An intersubjective perspective acknowledges the group leader's and other members' contributions to each member's here-and-now experience - as well as to the texture of their entire experience in the group.<sup>ibid</sup>
</blockquote>

<p>That is, the therapist not only has the opportunity to observe the client interacting with others, but also has the opportunity to watch the client begin to make meaningful experiences with the group as a whole.</p>

<blockquote>
The idea of the social microcosm is, I believe, sufficiently clear: <b>if the group is conducted such that the members can behave in an unguarded, unselfconscious manner, they will, most vividly, re-create and display their pathology to the group.</b> Thus, in this living drama of the group meeting, the trained observer has a unique opportunity to understand the dynamics of each client's behaviour.<sup>2</sup>
</blockquote>

<p>So, why can group therapy be so effective? It allows the therapist to watch the client interacting with others in real time. Rather than simply relying on the client’s recounting of interactions with others, the therapist can watch the client interacting in the moment. This provides opportunities to interact where feedback and learning can take place.</p>

        Here and Now in Therapy

    <h2 id="a-first-lesson">A First Lesson</h2>

<p>When I started <a href="/counselling" title="Counselling">counselling</a> others, I fell into one of the many traps common for young therapists. People will come into therapy and want to talk about everyone except themselves and they will want to cast blame on everyone except themselves. Some of the stories are incredibly compelling and young therapists can begin to unwittingly cooperate in these efforts.</p>

<p>Someone tells you of a horrendous person with whom they have to deal and you - having empathy for your client - begin to share these feelings for third persons. You might start to agree with the client about this other person and you might even begin to imagine ways to change the third person. You quickly learn as a therapist that these reactions are not in the best interest of your client. There is a big lesson here - THERAPY IS ALWAYS ABOUT THE PERSON IN THE ROOM. What does this mean?</p>

<h2 id="the-focus-of-therapy">The Focus of Therapy</h2>

<p>You aren’t in therapy to help Auntie Alice or the aggressive step-dad - you are there to help the person sitting across from you. Therapy is always about the person who comes to therapy. Yes, you can bring in significant others for the client’s sessions when appropriate, but this is always to help the client.</p>

<h2 id="the-here-and-now">The Here and Now</h2>

<p>One of the ways this is phrased in therapy is a reference to the “here and now”. In discussing group therapy (but this also holds for individual <a href="/counselling" title="Counselling">counselling</a> sessions), Irvin Yalom states:</p>

<blockquote>
<b>When the therapy group focuses on the here-and-now, it increases in power and effectiveness.</b>

But if the here-and-now focus (that is, a focus on what is happening in this room in the immediate present) is to be therapeutic, it must have two components: the group members must experience one another with as much spontaneity and honesty as possible, and they must also reflect back on that experience. This reflecting back, this <i>self-reflective loop</i>, is crucial if an emotional experience is to be transformed into a therapeutic one.<sup>1</sup>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="therapeutic-here-and-now">Therapeutic Here and Now</h2>

<p>When you stay in the moment with your client, the focus remains on the client and what they can do to deal with their difficulties. This focus on the present also allows your client to focus on emotions at the moment and reflect upon their meaning. This is where therapeutic change occurs.</p>

<h2 id="working-for-change">Working for Change</h2>

<p>Yes, our issues arise in various contexts. Yes, other people are involved in our lives. Within therapy, though, the focus is upon you, the client. Your therapist cannot change Auntie Alice, nor should they try.</p>

<p>A skilled therapist will be able to repeatedly bring the focus back to you, even when you keep discussing your difficult Auntie.</p>

<p>You are the focus of change. You cannot force others to change, but you can change yourself by allowing yourself to feel the emotions of the moment and reflecting upon what these emotions and the events which inspired them mean to you.</p>
