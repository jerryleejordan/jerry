<p>WhakatÅ«-Nelson, located at the northern end of New Zealandâs South Island, has a rich history dating back to the earliest Polynesian settlers who arrived around the 13th century. The region was originally inhabited by the MÄori people, who named it WhakatÅ«, meaning âbuild,â referring to the construction of waka (canoes) in the area. The MÄori established thriving communities sustained by fishing, hunting, and horticulture.</p>

In 1841, the New Zealand Company founded Nelson as a planned settlement, attracting European settlers seeking new opportunities and land.</p>
