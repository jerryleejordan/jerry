<p>Whakatū-Nelson, located at the northern end of New Zealand’s South Island, has a rich history dating back to the earliest Polynesian settlers who arrived around the 13th century. The region was originally inhabited by the Māori people, who named it Whakatū, meaning “build,” referring to the construction of waka (canoes) in the area. The Māori established thriving communities sustained by fishing, hunting, and horticulture.</p>
