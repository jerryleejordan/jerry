    <h2 id="exposure-therapy">Exposure Therapy</h2>

<p>Exposure therapy is part of <a href="/cognitive-behavioural-therapy" title="Cognitive Behavioural Therapy">Cognitive Behavioural Therapy</a> and involves gradually exposing oneself to the things of which you are afraid, as a way to show yourself that the results are not as bad as you fear they would be.</p>

<p>Alex has <a href="/body-dysmorphic-disorder" title="Body Dysmorphic Disorder">Body Dysmorphic Disorder</a> and his emphasis has been what he perceived to be the odd shape of his head. There were secondary focuses, too, but this was his main concern. Alex hid behind long hair for many years, until he decided to shave his head and show it to the world. Alex says that this has empowered him and helped to free him from his major struggles with <a href="/body-dysmorphic-disorder" title="Body Dismorphic Disorder">BDD</a>.</p>

<p>While many would not be able to so openly defy their fears, this podcast gives an insight into how Alex has used exposure to his fears as as way to overcome them.</p>

    <h2 id="nietzsche">Nietzsche</h2>

<p>Our family, our friends, our <a class="tooltip">whānau<span class="tooltiptext">te reo Māori: extended family</span></a> are part of the network of relations that ensure we have good mental health. So are our non-human companions. They accept us unconditionally! To be loved is an important part of feeling alive. There are so many ways to share life with others and loving and being loved are central to who we are.</p>

<p>In his influential book on group therapy, Irvin Yalom, while discussing interpersonal relations, states that the “theory of interpersonal relationships has become so much an integral part of of the fabric of psychiatric thought that it needs no further underscoring. People need people - for initial and continued survival, for socialization, for the pursuit of satisfaction. No one - not the dying, not the outcast, not the mighty - transcends the need for human contact.”<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>While Yalom mentions interpersonal interaction with people, which we absolutely need (with strained or lacking interpersonal relationships one of the main reasons for therapy), we also benefit from interaction with other animals and with nature more broadly.</p>

<p>After much discussion, my wife and I decided to add another to our family. She had never really interacted with dogs, so she was a bit nervous. My first dog was when I was eight and was a German Shorthaired Pointer (which is what we got this time). Nietzsche joined our family in April and the house is so much more lively with his enthusiasm and desire for cuddles!</p>

    <h2 id="mindbody-distinction">Mind/Body Distinction</h2>

<p>The mind and the body are not two separate things. When we attempt to treat the mind, but ignore the body, we are only scratching the surface of helping others.</p>

<p>Want to improve your mood - including helping treat your <a href="/depression" title="Depression">depression</a> - go for a walk!</p>

<p>Want to help yourself sleep - do some weight training or go tramping during the day!</p>

<p>There are so many things you can do to help yourself!</p>

<p>I have found that <a href="/yoga" title="Yoga">yoga</a> is an incredible way to take yourself into your body and out of your mind. It helps you become more limber, it helps you to feel your body, it helps you to focus your mind. It is truly one of the three most incredible things I have ever done for myself (meditation and being vegan being the other two).</p>

<p>Your body and mind are connected. Helping one helps the other.</p>

<p>I am currently researching <a href="/body-dysmorphic-disorder" title="Body Dysmorphic Disorder">Body Dysmorphic Disorder</a> (BDD) and came across this podcast series. It introduces the topic but - perhaps more importantly - has interviews with people who have struggled with <a href="/body-dysmorphic-disorder" title="Body Dysmorphic Disorder">Body Dysmorphic Disorder</a> and have found relief and better lives.</p>

<p>Worth a listen if this disorder affects you or someone you love!</p>

<p><img class="img-border" src="/img/irvin-d-yalom-group-psychotherapy.jpg" alt="The Theory and Practice of Group Psychotherapy" /></p>

<p>I wanted this book for awhile and, yes, those are my coffee stains on the cover. I first began reading Yalom when I was a <a href="/counselling" title="Counselling">counselling</a> student and read, “Love’s Executioner”. Yalom doesn’t disappoint.</p>

<p>I have long been interested in group therapy and Yalom was a pioneer in working with the dying in groups. I read once that people wondered why he would “waste” his time on the dying. While that is a shocking notion, it testifies to a relatively common perception at the time that resources could be “better spent” than on the dying.</p>

<p>I am reviewing this important book about group therapy and might have more to say on it, here.</p>
