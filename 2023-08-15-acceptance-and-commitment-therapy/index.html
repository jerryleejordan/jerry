<h2 id="history-of-act-a-brief-evolution">History of ACT: A Brief Evolution</h2>

<p>ACT emerged in the late 1980s from the collaborative efforts of psychologist Steven C. Hayes and his colleagues.

<h2 id="the-philosophy-of-act-psychological-flexibility">The Philosophy of ACT: Psychological Flexibility</h2>

<p>At the core of ACT lies the philosophy of psychological flexibility. This concept emphasises the importance of embracing one’s thoughts, emotions, and experiences without judgment or avoidance. ACT encourages individuals to develop a mindful awareness of their internal processes while aligning their actions with their deeply held values. This approach contrasts with attempts to control or eliminate unwanted thoughts and emotions, instead promoting a healthier relationship with them.</p>

<h2 id="techniques-of-act-six-core-processes">Techniques of ACT: Six Core Processes</h2>

<p>ACT employs six core processes to foster psychological flexibility:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Cognitive Defusion</strong>: Helping clients distance themselves from their thoughts, recognising them as mental events rather than absolute truths.</li>
  <li><strong>Acceptance</strong>: Encouraging the acknowledgment and acceptance of all emotional experiences, even the uncomfortable ones.</li>
  <li><strong>Present-Moment Awareness</strong>: Guiding individuals to cultivate <a href="/mindfulness" title="Mindfulness">mindfulness</a> and focus on the present moment.</li>
  <li><strong>Self-as-Context</strong>: Shifting clients’ perspective from identifying with their thoughts to understanding themselves as the context in which thoughts arise.</li>
  <li><strong>Values Clarification</strong>: Assisting individuals in identifying their core values and using them as a compass for meaningful action.</li>
  <li><strong>Committed Action</strong>: Encouraging clients to take purpose-driven steps aligned with their values, even in the presence of discomfort.</li>
</ol>
