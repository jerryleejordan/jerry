<p><a href="/cognitive-behavioural-therapy" title="Cognitive Behavioural Therapy">Cognitive Therapy</a>, a widely respected and effective therapeutic approach, focuses on addressing negative thought patterns that contribute to emotional distress and psychological struggles. One common cognitive distortion that frequently arises in therapy is discounting the positive. This cognitive distortion involves downplaying or dismissing positive experiences, achievements, or feedback while excessively focusing on the negative aspects of a situation.</p>

<h2 id="discounting-the-positive">Discounting the Positive</h2>

<p>In discounting the positive, individuals undermine their own successes and minimise any positive feedback they receive from others. For example, someone who receives praise for a job well done might attribute their success to luck or believe that others are simply being kind rather than acknowledging their own competence and hard work. This type of thinking can lead to feelings of self-doubt, low self-esteem, and a persistent sense of dissatisfaction.</p>

<h2 id="impact-of-discounting-the-positive">Impact of Discounting the Positive</h2>

<p>The impact of discounting the positive can be significant. It can contribute to a negative self-image, as individuals may believe that they are not worthy of success or praise. This cognitive distortion can also perpetuate a cycle of self-sabotage, as individuals may be hesitant to pursue new opportunities or challenges due to a lack of belief in their abilities.</p>

<p>In <a href="/cognitive-behavioural-therapy" title="Cognitive Behavioural Therapy">Cognitive Therapy</a>, therapists work collaboratively with clients to identify instances of discounting the positive and challenge the validity of these beliefs. Clients are encouraged to explore alternate perspectives and to consider whether their tendency to discount the positive is supported by evidence or simply automatic thoughts driven by the cognitive distortion.</p>

<h2 id="challenging-discounting-the-positive">Challenging Discounting the Positive</h2>

<p>Challenging discounting the positive can be a transformative process. It empowers individuals to recognise their accomplishments and strengths and to give credit where credit is due. By adopting a more balanced and self-compassionate way of thinking, clients can break free from the limitations of discounting the positive and cultivate a healthier and more positive self-image.</p>
