<p>Mindfulness, a contemporary approach with ancient roots, has emerged as a transformative practice for cultivating awareness, presence, and mental well-being. In the fast-paced modern world, mindfulness offers a sanctuary of stillness and self-discovery. With origins rooted in age-old contemplative traditions, mindfulness has found its place as a powerful tool for navigating the challenges of the present day.</p>

<p>While mindfulness draws inspiration from ancient contemplative practices, its recognition as a distinct approach gained momentum in the late 20th century. Rooted in Buddhist traditions, mindfulness, or “sati,” was initially cultivated as a means to develop insight and heightened awareness. As mindfulness migrated from Eastern to Western cultures, it evolved to encompass secular contexts, making it accessible to people from diverse backgrounds. This evolution marked the beginning of mindfulness as a standalone practice with applications beyond religious boundaries.</p>

<p>Mindfulness and meditation are often intertwined, yet they differ in their primary focuses. Meditation typically involves deliberate techniques, such as focused breathing or visualisation, to induce a state of tranquility and heightened awareness. On the other hand, mindfulness emphasises the quality of being fully present and attentive to the present moment, without judgment. While meditation often serves as a formal practice, mindfulness can be seamlessly woven into daily activities. The two practices complement each other, with meditation acting as a structured foundation and mindfulness enhancing an individual’s ability to sustain present-moment awareness.</p>
