<h2 id="types-of-dispute-resolution-processes">Types of Dispute Resolution Processes</h2>

<h3 id="1-negotiation">1. Negotiation</h3>

<p>Negotiation is an informal process in which parties involved in a dispute discuss their concerns and attempt to reach a mutually acceptable agreement. It is a common method for resolving interpersonal conflicts and business disputes.</p>

<h3 id="2-mediation">2. Mediation</h3>

<p>Mediation involves a neutral third party, known as a mediator, who helps the disputing parties communicate and find a resolution. Mediation is often used in family disputes, workplace conflicts, and community issues.</p>

<h3 id="3-arbitration">3. Arbitration</h3>

<p>Arbitration is a more formal process where a neutral arbitrator makes a binding decision based on the evidence and arguments presented by the parties. It is often used in contractual disputes and labour negotiations.</p>

<h3 id="4-litigation">4. Litigation</h3>

<p>Litigation is the formal legal process of resolving disputes through the court system. It is typically the last resort when other methods have failed. Litigation can be expensive and time-consuming.</p>

<h3 id="5-collaborative-law">5. Collaborative Law</h3>
