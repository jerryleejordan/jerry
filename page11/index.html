        Assumptions Exercise
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">24 Oct 2023</span>

    <h2 id="making-assumptions">Making Assumptions</h2>

<p>We all make assumptions - many of them - every day. We get part of the information we need and we fill in the gaps. We do this with all sorts of details. Have you ever seen the examples where a paragraph has large parts of words missing and you are able to read the paragraph easily? This is meant to show how our minds fill in the gaps and we don’t even really notice. This is one of the reasons we can have difficult spellchecking, looking over the same mistake repeatedly.</p>

<p>We also make these assumptions in our interactions with people. We get just a bit of information and guess the rest. This is normal and isn’t usually a problem, unless we repeatedly miss the intended meaning and end up in conflict. There is an interesting quote about finding people not where they are, but where we are. If we interpret a stranger as uncaring, for example, it is often the case that we have similar issues ourselves and we are projecting ourselves onto them.</p>

<h2 id="improving-relationships">Improving Relationships</h2>

<p>If you want a good relationship with your spouse or significant other, you need to either be in tune with them enough to properly fill in the gaps, or learn to understand their motivations better, so you can minimise future misunderstandings caused by you filling in the gaps wrong. When I was in pre-marriage <a href="/counselling" title="Counselling">counselling</a>, the person who was going to officiate our wedding said to us, “Always assume the best of each other!’ This is great advice if the other person is also assuming the best of you, but not good advice if you are assuming the best of them, but they are ascribing such negative motivations to you that they are emotionally preparing to move on from your relationship.</p>

<h2 id="assumptions-exercise">Assumptions Exercise</h2>

<p>How can you get to know your partner better and move on from incorrect assumptions? Try the following exercise. It will take a wee bit of time, but if you follow it consistently, you will both reap the rewards.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>When you find yourself in conflict or feel a misunderstanding brewing, quickly note the FACTS of what is happening. This is not your feelings (those come soon), but the details of what has happened.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After you have written down the facts, in a separate section write what you think was happening behind the facts - “S/he was mad at me!” “I knew she wanted something else from me!” This section is your INTERPRETATION of the facts. This is where your underlying assumptions come into play.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After you have written down the facts and your interpretations, in a third section write down how the facts and your assumptions made you FEEL. This part is important for a number of reasons, only one of which is to show you that the facts do NOT cause your feelings - your interpretation of the facts brings your emotional response.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="reviewing-assumptions-as-a-couple">Reviewing Assumptions as a Couple</h2>

<p>When the episode is finished (or by the end of the day), sit down with your partner and share what you have written. You might be surpised to find that your partner has an entirely different understanding of the events. The more you practice this with each other, the more you will begin to see how the other person evaluates events. This is a very important tool to help you survive together.</p>

<h2 id="getting-couples-counselling-assistance">Getting Couples Counselling Assistance</h2>

<p>If you are both trying this exercise together and you feel you need more help, you can bring your notes and yourselves ready to work together to our couples <a href="/counselling" title="Counselling">counselling</a> sessions. We are here to help you better understand each other and move foreward, stronger together.</p>

        Listening Exercise Notes
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">18 Oct 2023</span>

    <h2 id="reflections-on-listening-exercise">Reflections on Listening Exercise</h2>

<p>Yesterday, I wrote about a listening exercise that couples can use, both at home or in therapy, to begin to improve their relationship. I thought it might be a good idea to elaborate a bit more on this exercise, its purpose and make a few more notes.</p>

<h2 id="purposes-of-listening">Purposes of Listening</h2>

<p>Some people listen to defend themselves. When you start talking, they are looking for insults and ways to prepare a protective response. Some people listen to manipulate - once you start talking, they start looking for ways to understand you just enough to get what they want. There are a number of motivating factors in interpersonal interactions and many are self-serving.</p>

<h2 id="the-gift-of-listening">The Gift of Listening</h2>

<p>It could be argued that no form of listening is completely selfless, because even the most noble of intentions involve the individual’s desire to maintain the relationship (which is self-serving). Be that as it may, the exercise discussed yesterday is meant to allow us to grow in our relationships and to allow us to give something very precious to each other - the gift of our presence to another. You might imagine that your greatest gifts are cars, holidays, homes and such, but the greatest gift of yourself is your attention. Few of us really get the attention of others. There are always so so many distractions, both externally and in our heads. Learning to listen and giving our attention to each other is an incredible gift.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-our-motivations">Understanding our Motivations</h2>

<p>As we learn to listen, we start to realise that previously we were listening to defend, to persuade, to “fix” the other person or for some other unstated reason. At some level, the other person understands this and reacts. When you get defensive, they do too. When you try to persuade, they eventually get tired of this and either want to persuade you in return, or else shut down. If you want to fix them, they will tire of this - or else allow you to “fix” them so much that you no longer respect them for themselves. These self-serving motivations bring out self-serving motivations in the other person and communication is replaced by projections of our egos.</p>

<h2 id="changing-the-relationship">Changing the Relationship</h2>

<p>When you start to listen to understand the other person, things change. When they realise that you really want to know them - once the suspicion and doubt are gone - then you will find your partner opening up more freely. Your relationship can change in positive ways once you listen to each other to understand.</p>

<h2 id="listening-to-grow-other-relationships">Listening to Grow Other Relationships</h2>

<p>Not surprisingly, you will find that when you can truly listen to your partner, you will find yourself listening more fully to others, as well. From your children and <a class="tooltip">whānau<span class="tooltiptext">te reo Māori: extended family</span></a> to friends and colleagues, your relationships will open up as you practice the art of listening.</p>

<h2 id="practicing-listening">Practicing Listening</h2>

<p>Just as you need practice to learn most things, it will take time to grow your listening skills. Don’t be discouraged by setbacks. Sometimes, people will doubt your intentions in fully listening. Sometimes, people will try to get you back into defensive listening. See these experiences for what they are - chances to learn and grow. Keep up your practice with your partner and it will change your relationship.</p>

<h2 id="getting-help">Getting Help</h2>

<p>If you are struggling with your spouse to learn to listen more fully to each other, you can book a therapy session or two with us to see how we can help. We are here to help your relationships flourish.</p>

        Listening Exercise

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">17 Oct 2023</span>

    <h2 id="the-art-of-listening">The Art of Listening</h2>

<p>Most of us listen to respond. As someone is talking, we begin to gather our objections, our arguments, our defences. We aren’t REALLY listening, because we are preparing our response. This is not listening. This is defence and when couples do this, they are losing opportunities to understand each other, to grow closer and to develop the insights to survive the storms which will come in their relationship. Learning to listen - really listen - is imperative!</p>

<h2 id="the-practice-of-listening">The Practice of Listening</h2>

<p>So much of what we do in our lives is habit. We don’t realise how much we do on autopilot. This can be helpful when we are doing something boring upon which we don’t want to focus. It can be unhelpful and even disastrous when our habits are not ones which enrich our lives. If we aren’t in the habit of listening, it is difficult at first, but the effort is well worth it! How do we learn to listen? We practice, just like we learn to practice many other worthwhile things. Once our listening practice evolves, we will find it easier to listen and we will discover that our relationships are growing deeper and more rewarding - both for ourselves and others.</p>

<h2 id="the-gift-of-listening">The Gift of Listening</h2>

<p>So few people REALLY listen that when it happens, people notice (or at least sense) it. People feel cherished and understood when they are heard. They realise that they are valuable for themselves, not just for what they give you. If you want to be heard, first listen.</p>

<h2 id="signs-you-arent-listening">Signs you Aren’t Listening</h2>

<p>So, you might be saying, “I listen!” You might be saying, “How do I know if I am listening?” If you are saying the former, you aren’t ready for this lesson. If you are saying the later, this lesson is for you.</p>

<p>Are you unable to remember the substance of conversations? Do you feel yourself tense up defensively when others are talking? Do you find your mind wandering to finances, plans for the weekend or such when others are talking? Do you find yourself bored when others are talking? Do you find yourself distracted by other things in the environment when others are talking? These are but a few indications that you are not listening and need to practice this beautiful and compassionate art.</p>

<h2 id="listening-exercise">Listening Exercise</h2>

<p>An exercise that can be practiced between couples, both within a therapy session and outside of it, is to follow a set process for learning to listen better. It can go something like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Each person is allowed one minute to talk, UNINTERRUPTED. If there is interruption, the minute starts again. One minute may not sound like much at first, but if you aren’t a good listener, it will be more than enough to start your practice. Eventually, you will build up to FIVE minutes, but start with one minute, for now.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While one partner is talking, the other partner is listening to their words, watching their body movements (this, too, is part of communication) and truly trying to focus on what is being said.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After this minute, the listening partner tries to communicate back what was heard. This involves ZERO commentary or evaluation (hard for some people). You are simply trying to repeat what you have heard. If you start evaluating the content, the original speaker will note this and you will start your one minute of communicating back content again, this time without commentary. For some people, this is tough, so don’t get frustrated if you don’t get it right the first time (or few times)! Your goal is to simply repeat back what you have heard.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The original speaker comments on how being heard made them feel, such as, “Thank you for listening to me! That made me feel heard!” There is no script for this response, but is simply a chance for the one heard to express the emotions of being heard.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Partners switch roles and repeat #1 to #4.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>As this is a <strong>practice</strong>, try doing this at least once every day until listening becomes a habit.</p>

<h2 id="making-practice-part-of-life">Making Practice Part of Life</h2>

<p>You might suggest that these exercises feel somehow artificial, but the goal of practice is to bring something into your everyday life. What at first does not feel natural, due to exercise and the force of habit, becomes a part of your everyday life. This practice can be one of the greatest things to protect your relationship, so if you are serious about developing a stronger relationship, give it a go!</p>

<h2 id="when-you-need-more-help">When You Need More Help</h2>

<p>If this exercise is not easy for you and your partner and you want more help - such as trying this exercise in a <a href="/counselling" title="Counselling">counselling</a> session - you can book in with us, either online or if you are in Nelson NZ, in person.</p>

        Should Statements

    <h2 id="the-tyranny-of-should-statements-addressing-should-in-cognitive-therapy">The Tyranny of Should Statements: Addressing “Should” in Cognitive Therapy</h2>

<p><a href="/cognitive-behavioural-therapy" title="Cognitive Behavioural Therapy">Cognitive Therapy</a>, a widely respected and effective therapeutic approach, aims to address negative thought patterns that contribute to emotional distress and psychological difficulties. One common cognitive distortion that frequently arises in therapy is the use of “should” statements. This cognitive distortion involves rigidly imposing expectations on oneself or others about how things “should” be, leading to feelings of frustration, guilt, and dissatisfaction.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-should-statements">Understanding Should Statements</h2>

<p>In “should” statements, individuals create a set of rules or ideals for themselves and others, which often do not align with reality. For example, someone might believe that they “should” always be perfect at their job or that others “should” always treat them with kindness. When these expectations are not met, it can lead to feelings of failure and disappointment.</p>

<h2 id="mental-health-impacts-of-should-statements">Mental Health Impacts of Should Statements</h2>

<p>The impact of “should” statements can be profound. It can lead to a constant sense of inadequacy and self-criticism, as individuals judge themselves harshly for not living up to their own unrealistic standards. Additionally, the imposition of “should” on others can lead to strained relationships, as it sets up unattainable expectations that can breed resentment and conflict.</p>

<h2 id="cognitive-therapy-for-cognitive-distortions">Cognitive Therapy for Cognitive Distortions</h2>

<p>In <a href="/cognitive-behavioural-therapy" title="Cognitive Behavioural Therapy">Cognitive Therapy</a>, therapists work collaboratively with clients to identify instances of “should” statements and challenge the validity of these beliefs. Clients are encouraged to explore the evidence supporting their “should” beliefs and to consider more flexible and realistic alternatives.</p>

<h2 id="counselling-to-challenge-should-statements">Counselling to Challenge Should Statements</h2>

<p>Challenging “should” statements can be a transformative process. It empowers individuals to let go of rigid expectations and embrace a more compassionate and accepting attitude toward themselves and others. By adopting a more flexible and understanding way of thinking, clients can reduce feelings of guilt and self-blame, leading to improved self-esteem and healthier relationships.</p>

<h2 id="counselling-for-improved-mental-health-and-relationships">Counselling for Improved Mental Health and Relationships</h2>

<p>“Should” statements are a cognitive distortion that can significantly impact individuals’ emotional well-being and relationships. <a href="/cognitive-behavioural-therapy" title="Cognitive Behavioural Therapy">Cognitive Therapy</a> provides a valuable opportunity to address this thinking trap and promote positive change. By challenging “should” statements and adopting a more realistic and compassionate perspective, clients can free themselves from the tyranny of unrealistic expectations and experience greater self-acceptance and emotional fulfillment.</p>

        Polarised Thinking

    <span class="post-date">13 Oct 2023</span>

    <h2 id="the-pitfalls-of-polarised-thinking-in-cognitive-therapy">The Pitfalls of Polarised Thinking in Cognitive Therapy</h2>

<p><a href="/cognitive-behavioural-therapy" title="Cognitive Behavioural Therapy">Cognitive Therapy</a>, a widely recognised and effective therapeutic approach, focuses on addressing negative thought patterns that contribute to emotional distress and psychological struggles. One common cognitive distortion that frequently arises in therapy is polarised thinking, also known as black-and-white thinking or dichotomous thinking. This cognitive distortion involves perceiving situations, oneself, and others in extreme, all-or-nothing terms, without acknowledging any middle ground or shades of grey.</p>

<h2 id="the-cognitive-distortion-of-polarised-thinking">The Cognitive Distortion of Polarised Thinking</h2>

<p>In polarised thinking, individuals tend to view everything as either perfect or catastrophic, with no room for nuance or ambiguity. They see themselves as either a complete success or an utter failure, and they judge others as completely good or completely bad. This rigid way of thinking can be highly limiting and can exacerbate emotional difficulties.</p>

<h2 id="effects-of-polarlised-thinking-on-mental-health-and-relationships">Effects of Polarlised Thinking on Mental Health and Relationships</h2>

<p>The consequences of polarised thinking can be profound. When individuals perceive everything in absolutes, they tend to overlook the complexities of real-life situations and relationships. This can lead to difficulties in problem-solving, decision-making, and conflict resolution. Additionally, polarised thinking often contributes to heightened <a href="/anxiety" title="Anxiety">anxiety</a>, as individuals may worry excessively about potential negative outcomes.</p>

<h2 id="cogntive-therapy-for-the-cognitive-distortion-of-polarised-thinking">Cogntive Therapy for the Cognitive Distortion of Polarised Thinking</h2>

<p>In <a href="/cognitive-behavioural-therapy" title="Cognitive Behavioural Therapy">Cognitive Therapy</a>, therapists work collaboratively with clients to identify instances of polarised thinking and challenge its accuracy and helpfulness. Clients are encouraged to explore the evidence supporting these extreme beliefs and to consider alternate, more balanced perspectives. This process helps individuals develop a more realistic and flexible way of thinking, allowing for a broader range of emotions and responses to life’s challenges.</p>

<h2 id="counselling-to-challenge-polarised-thinking">Counselling to Challenge Polarised Thinking</h2>

<p>Challenging polarised thinking can be a transformative process. It empowers individuals to recognise the grey areas in life, embrace their imperfections, and adopt a more compassionate and forgiving attitude toward themselves and others. By cultivating a mindset that allows for complexities and uncertainties, clients can experience reduced <a href="/anxiety" title="Anxiety">anxiety</a>, improved mood, and enhanced problem-solving abilities.</p>

<h2 id="therapy-for-improved-mental-health">Therapy for Improved Mental Health</h2>

<p>Polarised thinking is a cognitive distortion that can significantly impact individuals’ emotional well-being and life satisfaction. In <a href="/cognitive-behavioural-therapy" title="Cognitive Behavioural Therapy">Cognitive Therapy</a>, addressing this type of thinking is a central component of promoting positive change. By challenging polarised thinking and adopting a more balanced perspective, clients can gain a deeper understanding of themselves and others, leading to increased resilience and greater emotional flexibility.</p>
